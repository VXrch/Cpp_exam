**Read before reading novel**
The Author's POV
I already wrote this in the synopsis, but I'll say it again.

Don't read this expecting another novel's extra. 

You can't compare a gem to a stone (this novel being the stone)

It'll just ruin your experience.

Regarding the update schedule. There really isn't one.

I'll upload when I can. This is a side hobby, after all, am busy with other stuff. Will try to give constant updates thought.

Update schedule 7-14 a week.

This is just a warning for future readers who are planning to give this story a go. Don't want to waste your time reading something that you might end up disliking. Saves your time.

Also, if you're planning on leaving a low rating. Please don't just put emojis on it and leave. If so I will delete them. Please write why you disliked it so that I and future readers can understand the flaws of this novel. 

Peace out.
