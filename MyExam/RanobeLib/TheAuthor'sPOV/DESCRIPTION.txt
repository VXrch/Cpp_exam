The person whom the world revolves around.\nThe person who defeats all of his opponents, and ultimately gets the beautiful girl.\nThe sole existence all villains fear.\nThat is the protagonist.\nWhat about me?\nAs a failed author who had only one success throughout his whole career, I had reincarnated into my late novel.\n«This is it»\nI thought, as I tightly clenched my fist.\nDid I just get reincarnated in my own novel?\nIs this where I reincarnate in a novel and become the protagonist?\nNo.\nSadly it’s not that kind of novel, as I reincarnated as a mob.\nThe world doesn’t revolve around me.\nThe girls don’t come flocking towards me.\nThe cheat items don’t come to me.\n«Phew»\nI let out a sigh of relief.\n«Thank god I’m not the protagonist»\nI joyfully shouted as tears streamed down my cheeks.\nWait, are you curious as to why I don’t want to be the protagonist?\nI did forget to mention the most important thing when I was describing a protagonist.\nThat is…\nThey are calamity magnets.\nI just died. If I learned something from that, it’s that it really isn’t a pleasant experience.\nIf possible let me live a long stable life.\nThank you, whoever reincarnated me.\nI would later come to regret these words…\n\n***\n\nReader Disclaimer:\n\nThere are two MCs in this story.\n1. The original MC of the novel\n2. The author that transmigrates in the novel\nIn the beginning, the author plays the role of an extra with no ambition other than quietly waiting for the story to end. He is almost like a babysitter that watches over the plotline, however, this will only be in the first 40 chapters or so as he will soon be dragged into the plotline regardless of how much he doesn’t want to.\nThe MC may come off as someone that has no ambition in the beginning but as the story progresses it will change\nAlso, there may be a bit of info-dumping at the beginning of the novel (at least the first 30 chapters), but there shouldn’t be anymore in the following chapters. Well…being a new author I may end up doing it again. If I do so please do criticize me and scold me. If you don’t scold me how am I supposed to improve the story? What’s great about writing web novels is that I actually can hear your advice and opinions. You are just as much invested in this story as I am, so please help me out.\nWell…I would appreciate it if you don’t leave a one star…not that I can stop you\nAlso, yes, the novel is inspired by TNE (The novel’s extra) you may see a lot of similarities in the beginning, but for future chapters the differences will start to become more apparent. I hope you manage to stick through it. Also, don’t come reading this expecting it to be another TNE. In fact don’t compare the two. If you do, the flaws of this book will become more apparent as you read ruining the whole experience
